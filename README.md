# About Me

Hello! I'm Andrei, a Database Administrator eager to transition into Front-end Development. I've acquired a strong foundation in managing databases, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing performance, all learned on the job.

Recognizing the dynamic tech industry, I've taken the initiative to broaden my skill set. I independently learned Front-end Development and honed my database administration skills in my current role, showcasing my self-motivation and dedication to professional growth.

Additionally, I invested in my skills by personally funding a Quality Assurance (QA) course. This commitment reflects my dedication to expanding my knowledge and contributing effectively to the ever-evolving field of technology.

I'm excited about merging my database management expertise with my self-taught front-end development skills to create innovative, user-centric solutions. My goal is to make a meaningful impact by blending the precision of database administration with the creativity and interactivity of front-end development.

Let's embark on this journey of exploration and growth together! Dive into my portfolio to learn more about my projects, skills, and experiences. If you have questions or collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out.
